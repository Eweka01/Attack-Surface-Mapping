## Utica University Attack Surface Mapping

This project involves using OWASP Amass to enumerate the subdomains of Utica University's domain (utica.edu) and visualize the discovered attack surface. The tools used include Amass and other potential tools for visualization and analysis.

## Tools Used:
- OWASP Amass: For domain enumeration and attack surface mapping.
- Go Language: Required to install and run Amass.
- Optional Tools: Gephi, Maltego, or Excel for external visualization if necessary.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Installation of OWASP Amass
Before enumerating the domain, ensure OWASP Amass is installed:
```bash
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v3/...@master
```
or
```bash
brew install amass
```

### 2. Enumeration of utica.edu
To enumerate subdomains associated with Utica University, run the following command:
```bash
amass enum -d utica.edu
```
If no results are found, you can use brute-force enumeration:
```bash
amass enum -brute -d utica.edu
```
Example of discovered subdomains:
```bash
ns2.utica.edu
lists.utica.edu
drupal.utica.edu
connect.utica.edu
```

### 3. Visualizing the Results
The tool oam_viz can be used to visualize the results, but if that doesnâ€™t work, you can generate output in other formats for analysis:
```bash
amass enum -o amass_output.txt
```

Alternatively, Amass has its own simple visualization:
```bash
amass viz -d utica.edu
```

You can also output the results in JSON for further processing:
```bash
amass enum -d utica.edu -json amass_output.json
```

### 4. Optional Visualization Tools
- Gephi: Import results into Gephi for advanced network graph visualization.
- Maltego: Use Maltego for mapping relationships between subdomains.
- Excel: Load CSV outputs into Excel to analyze and chart subdomains.

## Conclusion
This process outlines how to map the attack surface of a domain using Amass. The results can be further analyzed for potential vulnerabilities and network security issues. The generated results can be visualized using various external tools, depending on your preference and tool availability.
